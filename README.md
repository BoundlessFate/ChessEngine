# Chess Engine Code
Copied from my private git and github repo because that one has some sensitive data

Engine uses a tree to look ahead for moves, and has a basic evaluation function

Only things the bot does not account for are certain forms of stalemate (stalemate for lack of material and stalemate for repetition), but it does account for the 50 move rule.
