# Chess Engine Code
Copied from my private git and github repo because that one has some sensitive data

At the moment the chess engine doesnt really think ahead, but can check for every type of move.

Im in the works to add a recursive tree to find the best move.

Only things the bot does not account for are certain forms of stalemate (stalemate for lack of material and stalemate for repetition), but it does account for the 50 move rule.
