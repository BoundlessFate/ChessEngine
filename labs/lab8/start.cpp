// cell of the grid was blocked or open.  This would be the minimal
// representation for memory.

// However, debuggers (both traditional and memory debuggers) might
// not be able to help debug errors with vectors of booleans, if they
// are efficiently packed by a clever STL implementation.  So instead
// we use an enum, to improve readability, and to ensure that the
// status of each grid cell is stored as an integer avoiding debugger
// confusion during development.

// that is blocked --- meaning that no path can go through --- being
