material, etc.) you consulted in completing this assignment.

< insert collaborators / resources >

ORDER NOTATION:
For each of the functions below, write the order notation O().
Write each answer in terms of m = the number of rows and n = the
number of columns.  You should assume that calling new [] or delete []
on an array will take time proportional to the number of elements in
the array.

get

set

num_rows

get_column

operator<<

quarter

operator==

operator!=

swap_rows

rref (provided in matrix_main.cpp)



TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your Matrix class design & implementation?


EXTRA CREDIT: 
Indicate here if you implemented resize() for extra credit.  
Also document the order notation for your resize() function.
