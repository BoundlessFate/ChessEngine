Please be concise! (< 200 words)
What question you are trying to answer with your statistic? 
What data did you need to organize? 
What was interesting or challenging about the implementation of this statistic? 
	My statistic finds and outputs the homefield advantage of each team, 
	and the homefield MVP for the team with the greatest homefield advantage.
	Homefield advantage is calculated from the %WinsAtHome/%WinsOverall
	If you win more at home than overall, you have a homefield advantage.
	Homefield MVP was calculated by ranking all players by goals, assists, and penalties at home,
	and choosing the best player overall that was on the team with the highest homefield advantage.
